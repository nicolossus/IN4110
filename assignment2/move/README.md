### Move

Script for moving contents from one directory to another, hidden files and directories included. User prompt to ask whether they want to move content to a date- and timestamped directory within destination.

**Usage:** `move src_dir dst_dir [file_extension]`

File extension is written as e.g. `txt`, `jpg` or `dat`.

**Test implementation with:** `bash move.sh src dst [file_ext]`

To test again, run `bash copy_dir.sh`. This copies the content from the directory `src-cpy` to `src`.
