Finished 'random_array' in 0.0016 secs (averaged over 5 runs)
Finished 'loop' in 0.0169 secs (averaged over 5 runs)
Finished 'snake_loop' in 0.0904 secs (averaged over 5 runs)
'snake_loop' is slowest

Compared to time.time, 'random_array' and 'loop' are not quite identical but of the same order.
'snake_loop' however is 4-5 times faster according to timeit. This may caused by several factors
and averaging over just 5 experiments are not enough to claim this is the general case.
